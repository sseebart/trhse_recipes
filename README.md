# trhse_recipes
Recipes app from the Treehouse Object Oriented PHP course, ported partially to the web.

Code is ready to seed the database, execpt that a connection object will need to be created in /inc/connection.php.

A MySql database structure is included. Once set up and connected, loading cookbook.php should seed the database appropriately
and crudely render the existing recipes to the screen.

Still to do: pull data from the database to create recipe objects, create an input form to add and edit recipes, add
formatting, search and categorization tools.
